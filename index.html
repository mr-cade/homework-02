        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised north of Salt Lake in Bountiful, UT. I attended BYU and majored in Finance. My first job out of school was in the corporate finance department of Comcast NBC Universal - one of the largest telecom and media companies in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Comcast, I participated in a rotational program which moved me to three cities and three separate roles over the course of two years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My three rotations through the company were:
            <ol>
                <li>Revenue Financial Planning and Analysis - West Division Comcast Cable: Denver, CO</li>
                <li>First Run Syndication Ad Sales Analysis - NBC Universal: New York, NY</li>
                <li>Xfinity Home Product Team Financial Planning and Analysis - Comcast HQ: Philadelphia, PA</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, I enjoyed my work as well as the atmosphere and culture. I quickly became bored with the repetitive nature of my work and with the bureaucracy of such a large organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hoping that my dissatisfaction arose primarily from the environment, I moved back to Utah and began working for a Solar Development company in their treasury department. My responsibilites were primarily cash management. This too however, left me bored and looking for more. This led me to explore coding and I'm thrilled to be learning new technical skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <h4>Amateur Radio</h4>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me making contacts on HAM radio. I primarily operate on the 20 meter band during the day and the 40 meter band in the evening to take advantage of ionospheric propogation. Single Side Band phone (SSB) is my mode of choice. I have made contacts in 49 states, and I look forward to completing my "Worked All States" award by contacting Vermont. I am a member of the Amateur Radio Relay League and the Utah VHF Society.

                <h5>Radio Equipment</h5>
                <ul id="equip">
                    <li>Kenwood TH-D74A -- 2 meters through 70 centimeters handheld tranceiver. Used in my car with a magmount antenna for mobile operations</li>
                    <li>ICOM IC-7100 -- 160 meters through 70 centimeters. This is the all-mode crown jewel of my radio collection. I use it primarily on the 20 and 40 meter bands</li>
                    <li>Modified G5RV dipole antenna -- without an antenna tuner, this operates from 80 to 10 meters. An antenna tuner makes it possible to also operate on 160 meters and 6 meters. It is 92 feet long and hangs between two trees in my yard at 80 feet.</li>
                    <li>3/4 Wave j-pole antenna -- VHF/UHF base station antenna for statewide repeater work and simplex through the Salt Lake Valley.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Skiing</h4>
                <p>
                    My dad taught me how to ski when I was 3 years old. I fell in love with the sport and have continued skiing ever since. Gliding effortlessly across the snow is freedom.
