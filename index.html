I was a student at Bountiful High School where I participated in student council. Following high school I attended BYU and majored in Finance.</p>

                        My first job out of college was in the corporate finance department of Comcast NBC Universal. At Comcast, I participated in a rotational program which moved me to three cities and three separate roles over the course of two years.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        My three positions through the company were:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Revenue Financial Planning and Analysis - West Division Comcast Cable: Denver, CO</li>
                            <li>First Run Syndication Ad Sales Analysis - NBC Universal: New York, NY</li>
                            <li>Xfinity Home Product Team Financial Planning and Analysis - Comcast HQ: Philadelphia, PA</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        After my time at Comcast, I wanted to try working for a smaller company. I moved back to Utah and began working for a Solar Development company in their treasury department. My responsibilites were primarily cash management. This too left me bored and looking for more. This led me to explore coding and I'm thrilled to be learning new technical skills.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            When I'm not coding, you can find me making contacts on HAM radio. I primarily operate on the 20 meter band during the day and the 40 meter band at night to take advantage of ionospheric propogation. Single Side Band phone (SSB) is my mode of choice, although I have recently started to experiment with FT8, a powerful digital mode.
                        </p> 
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I have made contacts in all 50 states and 12 countries as far away as Austrailia with zero use of internet or other infrastructure. I am a member of the Amateur Radio Relay League and the Utah VHF Society.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            My dad taught me how to ski when I was 3 years old. I fell in love with the sport and have continued skiing ever since. Gliding effortlessly across the snow is freedom.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            My favorite terrain is steep and deep powder. When deep powder isn't in the cards, I prefer big mountain skiing and a fair amount of moguls.
